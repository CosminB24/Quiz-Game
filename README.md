# Quiz-Game
It's a project focused on learning a new programming language, Python, in which I aimed to implement as many new principles as possible

Phase 1: Building the logic behind the project. I want to make a stable version of a basic Quiz Game, with the exceptions handled and without bugs. The questions will be added from a data file (CSV) for the moment. Later, I will add a Database.‚úÖ

Phase 2: Create a GUI based on ancient greek theme, using Pygame (current idea, it can be changed). I want to make a playable and enjoyable product, by adding new features. The target is to have a more complex game, but based on a quiz game.‚è≥

Phase 3: Make it an online multiplayer game using sockets / networking.‚è≥

This document will be updated with new information and most concrete updates. üîú
